            Her lyrics are a hauntingly beautiful representation of the bittersweet emotions that flow through human existence. The powerful soundscapes and deep reverbated instrumentation when paired with her harmonic vocals create an experience that is next to impossible to pull away from. Her words stay with you long after the songs end. At a closer look the details etched into the framework of her lyrics and instrumentation make room for the listener to feel the full story in a matter of minutes. Her first single ‘gold’ is on track to drop at the end of 2022, with her debut EP following closely behind in 2023. Sami hopes to uplift the collective human consciousness through her music.
